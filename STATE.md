# Adaptive Trading Agent — STATE.md

**Last updated:** 2026-11-08  
**Project phase:** M1_MARKET_DATA  
**System mode:** RESEARCH_ONLY  
**Live trading:** Prohibited

## 1. Objective

Build a reproducible, risk-governed decision system that can determine whether a trading strategy has durable positive expectancy after costs. Engineering exists to support that decision; infrastructure completeness is not an objective by itself.

## 2. Active system scope

- Venue: Binance Spot only.
- Initial symbols: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT.
- Direction: long-only spot; no leverage, margin, or futures.
- Initial research intervals: 15m, 1h, 4h.
- 1m is deferred until a concrete strategy or execution-model requirement justifies its additional data volume.
- Maximum concurrent positions: 1.
- Research capital ceiling: CNY 30,000.
- Proposed drawdown guardrail: 20%; not a guarantee and not live-authorized.
- ATA single-trade risk budget: not yet approved.
- Initial live allocation proposal: CNY 1,000–3,000; not authorized.
- Deployment target: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Python 3.12, systemd, SQLite.
- LLM: research and explanation only; not in a latency-critical execution path.
- Binance market data: public read-only endpoints; no API key required for M1.

## 3. Permission state

```yaml
project_phase: M1_MARKET_DATA
system_mode: RESEARCH_ONLY
trading_allowed: false
account_simulation_allowed: false
ticket_generation_allowed: false
active_strategy: null
authorized_strategies: []
```

These permissions must remain false until separate evidence and approval gates are passed. Creating infrastructure or collecting data does not grant trading permission.

## 4. Completed milestone — M0 foundation

- Immutable typed decision records.
- Append-only JSONL decision journal.
- Fail-closed risk and permission governor.
- Automated CI.
- 19 pytest tests passed on the M0 PR head, including research-mode rejection, invalid inputs, unhealthy data, drawdown, position limits, exit-path handling, and journal replay.
- PR #1 is open and Ready for review; it has not been merged into main.

## 5. Current milestone — M1 market data

Implemented on branch `feat/m1-market-data`; PR #2 is a stacked draft targeting `feat/m0-foundation`.

- Unauthenticated Binance REST client using `data-api.binance.vision`.
- Server-time-based filtering of unfinished candles.
- Strict OHLCV, timestamp, interval, and ordering validation.
- Bounded retry behavior: 429 honors Retry-After; 418 stops immediately.
- Paginated synchronization with a three-bar overlap.
- SQLite WAL storage with exact decimal text, transactional writes, immutable candle keys, conflict detection, and SHA-256 batch provenance.
- CLI commands for market sync and data-quality audit.
- Ubuntu 24.04 systemd service/timer and installation script.
- Automated tests have been added; M1 CI validation is pending.

M1 acceptance requires:
1. Ruff and all automated tests pass.
2. A live public-REST smoke test on the Ubuntu server completes for both symbols and all three intervals.
3. Repeated sync is idempotent.
4. Audit output is reviewed; any historical gaps are explained or backfilled from source, never synthetically filled.
5. systemd timer and journald operation are verified.

## 6. Research status

No ATA strategy is active or authorized.

Potential future hypotheses:
- Trend / momentum continuation.
- Volatility expansion followed by trend confirmation.

These are unvalidated hypotheses, not trading signals. Each requires preregistration, baselines, time-ordered out-of-sample tests, cost stress, robustness analysis, and explicit stop criteria.

## 7. Legacy research tracks — unchanged

- STOCK_RS_PULLBACK_v1 remains ARCHIVED_NON_TRADABLE and INVALIDATED_BY_ENGINE_ERROR.
- ICT Binance v0.1 remains archived after negative validation/test results.
- Existing A-share research constraints and the legacy CNY 500 per-trade risk limit remain scoped to that prior track. They are not silently transferred to ATA.

## 8. Next actions

1. Complete M1 CI and review PR #2.
2. Merge PR #1 first, then retarget/rebase PR #2 onto main.
3. After both PRs are merged, deploy to Ubuntu 24.04 using `deploy/ubuntu24/install.sh`.
4. Run a one-year historical backfill for 15m, 1h, and 4h BTCUSDT/ETHUSDT.
5. Enable the five-minute systemd timer and review data-quality reports before strategy research.

## 9. Stop conditions

- Do not add an execution adapter before the research and risk contracts are tested.
- Do not add more symbols, venues, or LLM agents without evidence that they change a decision.
- Stop or archive a strategy when its preregistered failure criteria are met.
- Do not expand infrastructure work if it does not improve the quality or reproducibility of the trading decision.
